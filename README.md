Hello! Over the past few months I have been really grinding out my passion.
I have finally grasped the concept of javascript. Ive been researching time and time again, "What are the best methods of learning?"
I found it, Project based Learning. I have been continuously grinding out projects. I have made working apps and databases.
I am currently in the works of some great things, like a new Exam Scheduler for my college, and one of my Biggest projects yet, ProgLounge.
If you would like to see my progress and the things I do in this career, continue to look at my work and future projects.
